CodeRefinery artwork and logos.

The one that we are using most is I think the `logo-color-3d.*`.

old-logo-otherrepo is the contents of the repo
https://github.com/coderefinery/logo, which was basically the same as
coderefinery-artwork.  Entire repository (including names) is
preserved for the future's sake, most files have the same hashes as
those in `logo/`
