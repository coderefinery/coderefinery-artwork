These may be hotlinked from various sites, so edit carefully and check
each time.  If art without a specific event/date in filename are
considered generic and may be updated to reflect future events, even
if they are used for past events.  For example,
socialshare-workshops.{svg,png} may be updated to show the next
upcoming workshop, and this will also be updated on past workshops.
